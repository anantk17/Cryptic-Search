# CrypticSearch
Course Project for the Computer Security Course taken in Winter Semester 2015

Developed a prototype single user application, “CrypticSearch” , to search for  a keyword across remotely stored encrypted files through an android application. The application returns a list of files that contain that keyword, which can be later downloaded by the user. The keywords and the contents of the files are masked/encrypted in transit as well as in storage, thus preserving the privacy of user queries.
